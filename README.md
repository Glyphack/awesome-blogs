# Favorite Blogs

This project is a blog post scraper I wrote for my favourite blogs. It extracts post links and exports them as JSON files, making it easy to add them to a reader like [Readwise](https://readwise.io/).

## Supported Blogs

The scraper currently supports the following blogs, as indicated by the file names in the `src` folder:

- Command Center (Rob Pike) Blog
- Joel on Software
- Matklad

## Usage

```
uv run ./src/robpike.py
```
